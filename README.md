## 👋 Hey there, I'm Erick!

- 🏫 I'm an English teacher who is now transitioning to a career in tech.
- 📚 I've been teaching myself to code since last July using only free resources.
- 💻 Currently, I'm diving into Spring Boot and loving it!
- ⛰️ On the weekends, I enjoy hiking or spending time at the beach.
- 🌟 I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!
- 😄 A fun fact about me is that when I was 14, I was customizing Android ROMs for me and my friends!
- 🐧 I've been a Linux user for as long as I can remember.
